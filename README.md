# Multivariate Analysis of the 1985 Auto Imports Dataset

This project presents a multivariate data analysis of the **1985 Auto Imports Database**, obtained from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 26 variables describing a wide range of car characteristics, including physical properties, technical specifications, performance, fuel efficiency, price, and insurance-related risk indicators.

The original data was compiled by Jeffrey C. Schlimmer using information from automotive yearbooks, technical manuals and insurance reports from 1985. It includes both categorical and continuous variables, making it a suitable case study for classical multivariate analysis techniques.

The main goal of this project is not prediction, but **understanding the internal structure of the data**. Through dimensionality reduction and exploratory methods, the analysis aims to uncover relationships between variables and similarities between vehicles, providing a clearer view of the information hidden in the dataset.

The workflow includes data preprocessing and descriptive statistics, followed by the application of several multivariate techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), Correspondence Analysis, clustering methods, Discriminant Analysis and MANOVA. These methods are used to reduce dimensionality, identify patterns and interpret the relationships between variables and individuals.

All analyses have been carried out using the **R programming language**.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes general variables such as the car manufacturer, price, insurance risk classification (symboling) and estimated normalized losses. It also contains variables related to the car’s shape and size, including dimensions and weight, as well as technical and performance-related features such as engine specifications, fuel system, horsepower and fuel consumption.

A detailed analysis of all variables and methods can be found in the accompanying report.
